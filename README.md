# Structure Consistent Frontend Layout

Many websites have a common layout that provides a consistent user interface as users navigate from one page to another. This layout usually includes elements such as the site header, navigation, and footer.

This leads to a common notion, especially with ones who have worked with traditional content management systems, that everything appearing on a page is required to be fetched from an entry, with references to common UI elements.

In this document, we'll discuss how we can create a consistent website layout using Express and Contentstack.
