## Structure Consistent Frontend Layout

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

Many websites have a common layout that provides a consistent user interface as users navigate from one page to another. This layout usually includes elements such as the site header, navigation, and footer.

We have created a sample website that demonstrate how you can achieve this. The example app is created using node.js. Download the code and read our step-by-step guide to learn more about it.
